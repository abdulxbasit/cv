  <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
  <p>My Programming Adventures lets put it this way started when I first tried to learn html and created my first website
    I was so fascinated my the fact that its so easy simple and easy to understand. And I always thought like from the
    start of my Education that i would be a software Engineer some day and i am gonna make the coolest appes and the coolest
    Websites. To me the feeling of being able to create something on the internet felt magical because i love tech an all. After
    that i started with C++ with which i had many difficulties but after that i started learning react native it is the best thing
    ever happenend to me because it gave me a direction a path to follow. Also i loved making Apps. I enjoy it a lot. I have an experience of
    2 months in react native i had still got lot to learn my web experience is also 2 months almost and my graphic and Ui experience is almost
    2 months. So a lot Journey ahead but i will be doing great things InshAllah.</p>
